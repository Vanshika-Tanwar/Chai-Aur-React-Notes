What's inside index.html of public folder, in the react lib
also how it's SPA
how react flows, it's custom tags

how react writes html code(uses a function, what boy i thought it would be too complex)
how js files getloaded in index.html by the helper; react-scripts!

but vite m kaise?
vite does it the classic way
That's majorly how vite is lighter than react
